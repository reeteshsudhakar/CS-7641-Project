# Introduction / Background
Banks and financial institutions act as money lenders and provide loans, as well as credit lines for millions of customers worldwide. However, for them to operate in a profitable manner and reduce the risk of their customers defaulting on payments for loans, they have to be able to accurately assess an individual's potential to default on their credit (in general, their overall credibility). This is also highly beneficial for them to determine the amount of interest that they should be charging on a given loan, and overall, whether they should offer the loan in the first place. This project is based around building a binary classification model that can be used to predict whether a borrower will default on their loan (meaning that they are unable to pay back a loan provided by a financial institution). A review of relevant literature showed us that privately securitized adjustable-rate mortgages have much more variance in performance when compared to retained mortgages, underscoring the importance of providing financial institutions with the best tools to aid decision making processes [(Krainer & Laderman, 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10693-013-0161-7‌). Delving into the literature revolving around this topic also greatly helped influence decisions made for this report, which will be elaborated on further in later sections.

For this project, our team opted to use the dataset provided by the Home Credit Group from a Kaggle competition. This data set has over 100 features about loan applicants and their credit risk. The dataset can be found at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data). In later sections, we discuss how we processed, cleaned, and reduced the data set to create a binary classification model to determine if applicants will default or not.

# Problem Definition
In today's volatile housing market, numerous potential borrowers face challenges in securing loans, often hindered by limited or absent credit histories. This situation breeds opportunities for unscrupulous lenders to exploit such individuals, while traditional banks miss out on viable clients due to irregular assessment methods. Emphasizing the crucial need for accurate predictions of loan repayment, it's imperative to ensure that qualified borrowers aren't unjustly denied. Equally vital is the early identification of likely defaulters to avert financial losses. Relying solely on manual risk assessment is not only time-consuming but also subject to human biases and inconsistency. Therefore, the development of a model to categorize individuals based on their repayment risk is essential. Such a model can help financial institutions streamline the evaluation process, enhance consistency in risk assessment, and significantly lower the incidence of loan defaults.
